This is a list of things I want to do with this, I just haven't gotten
around to doing it. Patches are certainly welcome.

	- Bundling WebDMA as a library
	
	- It would be really nice to have the adjustment bars
	
	- It could be interesting to support custom types as proxies, but
	thats probably too annoying. 
	
	- Theres a ton of potential here for data aquisition, its just a matter
	of implementing it. 
	
	- Flot (javascript graphing library) is included, but it isn't
	used at all yet. Need to improve the data aquisition stuff so we
	can use that. 
	 
	- The HTTP API needs to be documented, and expanded so that multiple
	variables can be modified at once (among other things). Currently, 
	its designed for a user to interact with it, so theres no need 
	for being able to vary more than one thing at once. However, theres 
	a lot of neat control applications that could be written with a better 
	API available.
