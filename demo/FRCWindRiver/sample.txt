WebDMA FRC Simple Robot Demo
--------------------------------

This program is a really simple example program 
that allows you to easily determine if WebDMA is
working properly on your robot. This program 
allows you to control the Jaguars attached to the 
first two PWMs via the web interface provided by
WebDMA.

You must load the robot with the WebDMA object 
file using the "WebDMA FRC Robot Upload" program 
before this will link properly.  

To view the web interface, start the program
and view http://10.xx.yy.2/ where xx and yy
are the first two and last two digits of your
team number (ie, team 2423 uses 10.24.23.2 )
