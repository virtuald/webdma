/**
	\class StaticDeleter
	\brief Deletes a pointer when this object goes out of scope
	
	Generally, this is useful for implementation of the singleton pattern
	in some form, such as the following example:
	
	\code
	
	SomeType * SomeType::m_instance = NULL;
	StaticDeleter<SomeType> someTypeDeleter(&m_instance);
	
	SomeType * SomeType::GetInstance()
	{
		if (SomeType::m_instance == NULL)
			SomeType::m_instance = new SomeType();
		return SomeType::m_instance;
	}
	
	\endcode
	
	@warning A key assumption made by this class is that the static object
	is only accessed during the normal scope of the program -- ie, the object
	that this class contains a pointer to a pointer to should not be accessed
	by anything that could be called after main() is complete. For some code
	bases, this can be very tricky to enforce.
